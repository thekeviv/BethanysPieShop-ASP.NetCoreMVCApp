# BethanysPieShop-ASP.NetCoreMVCApp

## Description

In this project, the goal was to make a website for a Pie Store called BethanysPieStore.
I made this project as a part of Building Web Applications with ASP.Net Core MVC Course 
by Gill Cleeren on Pluralsight. I used to think of MVC as an outdated technology and 
although I still think that modern Javascript libraries have imporoved in terms of reducing 
complexity, I have to agree that the MVC pattern makes development so much easier as well once 
you get a grasp of it. 

This project included features like :
1. Showing customers different Pie Options
2. A Shopping Cart for customers to add products to
3. A contact page built using a custom Tag Helper
4. Authentication and Authorization built using ASP.Net Identity
5. Session handling for cart which is done through browser cookies 
and added using an ASP.Net middleware.

The project uses Entity Framework Core as it's ORM and works with a SQL Server Database to 
store data. It was built in Visual Studio 2019 16.5.2.

## Instructions on Starting the Project

1. Clone the project.
2. Build the Project
3. Start the IIS Express server which will open the website in your default browser.
